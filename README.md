# Zebrands Backend Technical Test Project
## Deployed environment
### Deployed url: [Zebrands Products Catalog API](http://3.129.97.67/api/docs#/)
This url redirects you to the swagger documentation of the API

### Credentials of the superuser
```
username = "admin"
password = "admin"
```

## Getting started locally
### Docker
Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) as this project uses docker to containerize the environment

### Technologies, frameworks and libraries
- Package manager: To manage the project packages, this project uses `uv` which is a fast Python package and project manager built using Rust. [More about uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
    - This also allows a better control of the packages installed and enhances the development of the application by ensuring package consistency thanks to the `uv.lock` file
- REST API: The REST API is developed using django rest framework due to the built in features like authentication, testing framework and an ORM
- Email notifications: For the email notifications, its using `SMTP Gmail` as Amazon SES production environment is not available without a website and a domain.
    - Without the production environment, we can only send emails to verified emails in the AWS dashboard, something that is not realistic for the purpose of this project as it makes sense to send emails without this verification.

### Project structure
```
- .github
- catalog-system
    - api
        - migrations
        - models
        - serializers
        - tests
    - main
```
The project is contained inside `catalog-system` folder
- The `main` folder contains the main configuration files of the django rest app
- The `api` folder contains the application logic
    - The `migrations` folder is autogenerated upon migrating the models to the database
    - The `models` folder contains all the model files of the project
    - The `serializers` folder contains all the serializer files of the project
    - The `tests` folder contains all the test files of the project

This project structure allows maintainability and scalability for small to medium sized projects as it can separate the responsibilities of different modules such as users and products
- For bigger projects this can change to a feature-based structure, where each top folder represents a feature or domain. Example:
    ```
    - catalog-system
        - api
            - products
                - model.py
                - serializer.py
                - test.py
            - users
                - model.py
                - serializer.py
                - test.py
        - main
    ```

### Environment variables
To run this project locally, you need to create 2 `.env` files:
- Top level (same level as `catalog-system`): This `.env` file is used to create the PostgreSQL container with the necessary configuration
    ```
    DB_USERNAME="" # Main username created for the PostgreSQL image
    DB_PASSWORD="" # Password of the main username
    DB_NAME="" # Name of the database that will be created once the image is built
    ```
- Inside catalog-system: This `.env` file is used in the django project to handle database connections and email provider credentials
    ```
    DB_NAME="" # Same as the one defined in top level .env
    DB_USER="" # Same as the one defined in top level .env
    DB_PASSWORD="" # Same as the one defined in top level .env
    DB_HOST="zebrands-postgres-db" # Name of the service in docker-compose.yaml
    DB_PORT="5432" # Internal port of docker container defined in docker-compose.yaml
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD="" # GMAIL application password
    EMAIL_HOST_USER="" # GMAIL email address
    ```
### Executing the application
Once the environment variables are setup with docker installed, execute the following command to initialize the environment
```
docker compose up
```
- For development of the application, run the following command as it will sync and/or rebuild the application based on changes done to the app.
    ```
    docker compose watch
    ```
After the containers finished building, go to the following url where you will have access to the swagger documentation
- [http://localhost:3001/api/docs#/](http://localhost:3001/api/docs#/)

## Testing
The tests are configured to run on every pull request throught a github workflow. You can run the tests locally too.

### Running locally
[Install](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) the uv package manager.

Once you've installed `uv`, you can install all the project packages by running the following command
```
uv sync --locked
```
- This command will create you a python environment (or use the one you have in case there is) and install the correct version of the libraries. 

Locate yourself where the `manage.py` file is and run the following command to run the whole test suite
```
uv run manage.py test api -v 2
```
